# OpenAI Realtime API Integration - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented true voice-to-voice conversations using OpenAI's Realtime API integrated with Telnyx telephony. Callers can now have natural voice conversations with the AI assistant without requiring button presses or text input.

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Caller â†’ Telnyx Call 
       â†“
Telnyx answers call
       â†“
Telnyx starts media streaming via WebSocket
       â†“
Backend receives audio stream
       â†“
Voice Bridge Service coordinates:
  - Forwards caller audio to OpenAI Realtime API
  - Receives AI voice responses from OpenAI
  - Sends AI audio back to Telnyx
       â†“
Caller hears AI response in real-time
```

### Key Components

#### 1. OpenAI Realtime Service (`openai_realtime_service.py`)
- Manages WebSocket connection to OpenAI Realtime API
- Handles audio encoding/decoding (PCM16 and G.711 Âµ-law)
- Sends caller audio to OpenAI
- Receives AI voice responses
- Manages conversation state and events

#### 2. Telnyx Service (`telnyx_service.py`)
- `start_streaming()`: Initiates media streaming for a call
- `stop_streaming()`: Ends media streaming
- Configures codec (G.711 Âµ-law) for audio compatibility

#### 3. Voice Bridge Service (`voice_bridge_service.py`)
- Coordinates bidirectional audio between Telnyx and OpenAI
- Manages active sessions and stream IDs
- Routes audio packets correctly using Telnyx stream_id
- Handles session lifecycle and cleanup

#### 4. Webhook Handler (`telnyx_webhooks.py`)
- `/telnyx/incoming`: Handles Telnyx webhook events
- `/telnyx/stream/{call_control_id}`: WebSocket endpoint for media streams
- Triggers streaming when call is answered

## Technical Details

### Audio Format
- **Telnyx â†’ Backend**: G.711 Âµ-law, 8kHz, base64-encoded
- **Backend â†’ OpenAI**: PCM16 or G.711 Âµ-law (configurable)
- **OpenAI â†’ Backend**: PCM16 audio deltas
- **Backend â†’ Telnyx**: Base64-encoded audio with stream_id

### WebSocket Protocol

**Telnyx Events (Received)**:
- `start`: Stream initialized, provides stream_id and media format
- `media`: Audio chunk from caller (base64 payload)
- `stop`: Stream ended
- `error`: Error occurred

**Telnyx Commands (Sent)**:
- `media`: Send AI audio to caller (requires stream_id)
- `clear`: Clear audio queue (stop playback)

**OpenAI Events**:
- `session.created`: Session established
- `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`: User started speaking
- `response.audio.delta`: AI voice response chunk
- `response.text.done`: Transcript completed

## Environment Setup

Required environment variable:
- `OPENAIAPI`: OpenAI API key (already configured âœ“)
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS`: Auto-populated by Replit for WebSocket URL

The backend automatically constructs the WebSocket URL:
```python
wss://{REPLIT_DOMAINS}/telnyx/stream/{call_control_id}
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Configure Telnyx Phone Number
In the Telnyx portal, configure your phone number to send webhooks to:
```
https://{your-replit-domain}/telnyx/incoming
```

### 2. Make a Test Call
1. Call your Telnyx phone number
2. The system will:
   - Answer the call
   - Start media streaming
   - Connect to OpenAI Realtime API
   - Enable voice conversation

3. Speak naturally to the AI assistant
4. Listen to AI voice responses in real-time

### 3. Monitor Logs
Check backend logs for:
- `[Telnyx] Call answered, starting OpenAI Realtime voice session`
- `[Telnyx Stream] WebSocket connected for call: {id}`
- `Telnyx stream started: {stream_id}`
- `OpenAI Realtime session created`
- Audio transmission logs

### 4. Verify Audio Flow
The logs should show:
- Audio being sent to OpenAI
- AI responses being received
- Audio being sent back to Telnyx with stream_id
- Transcripts of the conversation

## Critical Fix Applied

**Issue**: AI audio wasn't reaching callers
**Root Cause**: Missing `stream_id` in media messages sent to Telnyx
**Solution**: Added `stream_id` to all Telnyx media/clear messages

Before:
```python
{"event": "media", "media": {"payload": "..."}}
```

After:
```python
{"event": "media", "stream_id": "{id}", "media": {"payload": "..."}}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test with real phone call** to verify end-to-end voice flow
2. **Monitor logs** for any errors or issues
3. **Verify audio quality** and conversation flow

### Future Enhancements
1. Add voice activity detection for better turn-taking
2. Implement conversation context persistence
3. Add support for multiple simultaneous calls
4. Integrate with learning modules for educational content
5. Add call analytics and recording capabilities
