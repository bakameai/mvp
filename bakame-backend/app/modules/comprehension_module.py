She spoke to her neighbors about starting a community garden where everyone could grow vegetables together. At first, only a few families joined, but as the garden flourished with tomatoes, beans, and cabbage, more neighbors wanted to participate. They shared the harvest equally, and no family went without fresh food. The garden became a place where children learned about farming and neighbors strengthened their bonds through Ubuntu - the spirit of togetherness.",

He developed a mobile money system that allowed people to send and receive money using their basic phones. His innovation helped farmers sell their crops to buyers in Kigali without traveling long distances, and families could support each other across the country.
