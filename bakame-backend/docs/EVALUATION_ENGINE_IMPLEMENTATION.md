### Evaluation Engine Core Logic
```python
async def evaluate_response(self, user_input: str, module: str, stage: str, 
                          user_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    schema = self.evaluation_schemas.get(module, {}).get(stage, {})
    
    # Multi-factor assessment
    keyword_score = self._evaluate_keywords(user_input, schema)
    structure_score = self._evaluate_structure(user_input, schema)
    llm_score = await self._evaluate_with_llm(user_input, schema)
    
    # Weighted final score
    weights = schema.get("assessment_weights", {})
    final_score = (
        keyword_score * weights.get("keyword_match", 0.4) +
        structure_score * weights.get("sentence_structure", 0.3) +
        llm_score * weights.get("llm_evaluation", 0.3)
    )
    
    # Pass/fail determination
    pass_threshold = schema.get("advancement_criteria", {}).get("pass_threshold", 0.6)
    is_pass = final_score >= pass_threshold
    
    # Emotional intelligence
    emotional_state = await self._detect_emotional_state(user_input, user_context)
    feedback = self._select_feedback(is_pass, emotional_state, schema)
    
    return {
        "overall_score": final_score,
        "is_pass": is_pass,
        "emotional_state": emotional_state,
        "feedback": feedback,
