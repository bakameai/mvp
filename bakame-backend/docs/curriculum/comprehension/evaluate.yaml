  Evaluate this presentation: "I believe exercise is important. My friend lost weight by running. Therefore, everyone should run every day to be healthy."
  Judge this argument. Is it strong or weak? What's your evaluation and why?

expected_structure:
  - "â‰¥3 complete sentences"
  - "makes clear evaluation judgment"
  - "identifies argument weaknesses"
  - "provides reasoning for judgment"

llm_scoring_criteria:
  temperature: 0.2
  rules:
    - "evaluates argument as weak or problematic"
    - "identifies over-generalization from single example"
    - "recognizes lack of broader evidence"
    - "demonstrates evaluative thinking about argument quality"
  
keywords:
  positive: ["weak", "one example", "not enough", "over-generalization", "needs more evidence", "limited"]
  negative: ["strong", "good argument", "convincing", "proves it"]

feedback_templates:
  pass: "Excellent evaluation! You recognized that one personal example isn't enough evidence for a universal claim."
  fail_hint: "Think about this: if one person succeeded with running, does that prove everyone should run every day?"
  fail_repeat: "Good thinking! The argument is weak because it uses just one example to make a claim about everyone."
  encouragement: "Evaluating argument strength is sophisticated thinking! You're developing critical judgment skills."

emotional_responses:
  hesitation: "Consider: is one friend's experience enough to prove what's best for millions of different people?"
  confusion: "Think about it: the speaker jumps from 'my friend lost weight' to 'everyone should run daily.' Is that logical?"
  frustration: "Evaluating arguments requires careful thinking! You're learning to be a critical consumer of information."
