ivr_prompt: |
  Let's understand how mental math works. I'll show you a trick: to multiply by 11, you can add the digits.
  For example, 23 × 11 = 253 because 2 + 3 = 5, and you put it in the middle.
  Can you explain why this works? What's happening with the numbers?

expected_structure:

feedback_templates:
  pass: "Excellent understanding! You see that multiplying by 11 creates a pattern with place values."
  fail_hint: "Think about what 11 really means: 10 + 1. When you multiply, you're adding the number to itself shifted over."
  fail_repeat: "Good try! The trick works because 11 = 10 + 1, so you're adding the original number in different positions."
  encouragement: "Understanding why math works is more important than just memorizing tricks!"

emotional_responses:
  hesitation: "Think about place values: tens, ones, hundreds. What happens when you multiply by 10 + 1?"
  confusion: "Let me break it down: 23 × 11 = 23 × 10 + 23 × 1 = 230 + 23 = 253."
  frustration: "Math patterns can be tricky to see at first. You're developing mathematical thinking!"
