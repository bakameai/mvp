  Let's analyze different ways to solve the same problem. To calculate 47 × 8, you could do:
  Method 1: 47 × 8 = 40 × 8 + 7 × 8 = 320 + 56 = 376
  Method 2: 47 × 8 = 50 × 8 - 3 × 8 = 400 - 24 = 376
  Which method do you think is easier and why? Analyze both approaches.

feedback_templates:
  pass: "Great analysis! You understand that rounding to 50 makes the calculation easier with round numbers."
  fail_hint: "Think about which numbers are easier to work with: 40 and 7, or 50 and 3? Round numbers are usually simpler."
  fail_repeat: "Good thinking! Method 2 is often easier because 50 × 8 = 400 is simpler than 40 × 8 + 7 × 8."
  encouragement: "Analyzing different strategies is what mathematicians do! You're thinking like a problem solver."

emotional_responses:
  hesitation: "Consider which multiplication is easier: 50 × 8 or 40 × 8? Round numbers are your friend!"
  confusion: "Let me help: 50 × 8 = 400 is easy to calculate, then you just subtract 24. That's often simpler."
  frustration: "Comparing strategies is advanced thinking! You're developing mathematical judgment."
