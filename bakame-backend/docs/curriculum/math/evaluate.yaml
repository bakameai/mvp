ivr_prompt: |
  A student solved 125 × 16 like this: "125 × 16 = 125 × 10 + 125 × 6 = 1250 + 750 = 2000"
  Evaluate this solution. Is it correct? Is it the best method? What's your judgment and why?

feedback_templates:
  pass: "Excellent evaluation! The answer is correct, and you recognized this is a solid method using the distributive property."
  fail_hint: "Check the math: 125 × 10 = 1250, 125 × 6 = 750, so 1250 + 750 = 2000. Is this right?"
  fail_repeat: "Good try! The solution is correct. 125 × 16 = 2000. The method breaks down 16 into 10 + 6."
  encouragement: "Evaluating mathematical work requires careful checking. You're developing critical thinking!"

emotional_responses:
  hesitation: "Work through it step by step. First check if 1250 + 750 = 2000, then see if that equals 125 × 16."
  confusion: "Let me help you check: 125 × 16. We can verify: 125 × 4 = 500, so 125 × 16 = 500 × 4 = 2000."
  frustration: "Checking other people's work is challenging! You're learning to be mathematically critical."
