# Math - Understand Stage (Bloom's Taxonomy)

## 🎯 Learning Goal
Students will explain mathematical concepts, demonstrate understanding of number relationships, and show comprehension of basic mathematical principles.

## 📖 Source & Content
- **Primary Source**: Fundamentals of Mathematics
- **Page/Chapter**: Chapters 3-4 (Number Relationships)
- **Supplementary**: Rwandan practical applications

## 🧩 Key Skills
- Explaining mathematical operations and their meanings
- Understanding place value and number patterns
- Demonstrating comprehension of mathematical relationships
- Interpreting simple word problems

## 🗣️ Voice Prompts (≤10s each)
1. "Explain what happens when we multiply a number by 2."
2. "Why is 15 bigger than 12?"
3. "What does it mean to divide something equally?"
4. "If I have 20 francs, how many 5-franc coins is that?"
5. "Explain why 3 + 4 gives the same answer as 4 + 3."

## 🎤 Expected Student Responses
- Conceptual explanations: "It makes the number twice as big", "You double it"
- Comparative understanding: "15 has more", "It's 3 more than 12"
- Process descriptions: "You share it fairly", "Everyone gets the same amount"
- Practical applications: "Four coins", "Four 5-franc pieces"
- Mathematical principles: "The order doesn't matter", "You get 7 both ways"

## ✅ Assessment Criteria (PASS/FAIL)
**PASS Requirements:**
- Correctly explains 3 out of 5 mathematical concepts
- Shows understanding of number relationships
- Demonstrates comprehension through appropriate examples

**FAIL Indicators:**
- Cannot explain basic mathematical operations
- Shows no understanding of number relationships
- Provides confused or unrelated explanations

## 📊 Advancement Rules
- **Promote to Apply**: 3 successful sessions out of last 5 attempts
- **Stay at Understand**: 40-70% success rate
- **Demote to Remember**: 3 consecutive failures with basic concepts

## 🌍 Cultural Context
- Agricultural examples: "If one cow gives 10 liters of milk per day..."
- Community sharing: "When we share 12 bananas among 4 children equally..."
- Traditional counting: "Like counting coffee beans - each group of 10 makes counting easier"
