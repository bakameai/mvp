# Math - Create Stage (Bloom's Taxonomy)

## üéØ Learning Goal
Students will design original mathematical problems, create new problem-solving strategies, and generate mathematical models for real-world Rwandan situations.

## üìñ Source & Content
- **Primary Source**: Precalculus - OpenStax
- **Page/Chapter**: Chapters 1-2 (Functions and Modeling)
- **Supplementary**: Rwandan innovation and entrepreneurship contexts

## üß© Key Skills
- Creating original word problems and mathematical scenarios
- Designing new approaches to solve mathematical challenges
- Developing mathematical models for real situations
- Inventing mathematical games or puzzles

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Prompts (‚â§10s each)
1. "Create a math problem about starting a small business in Rwanda."
2. "Design a way to fairly divide profits among 3 business partners."
3. "Invent a math game that helps children learn multiplication."
4. "Create a budget plan for a family saving to buy a motorcycle."
5. "Design a formula to calculate how much paint is needed for a house."

## üé§ Expected Student Responses
