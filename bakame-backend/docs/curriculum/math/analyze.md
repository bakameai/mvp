# Math - Analyze Stage (Bloom's Taxonomy)

## üéØ Learning Goal
Students will break down complex mathematical problems, identify patterns and relationships, and analyze mathematical structures to understand underlying principles.

## üìñ Source & Content
- **Primary Source**: Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction
- **Page/Chapter**: Chapters 1-2 (Logic and Patterns)
- **Supplementary**: Rwandan data analysis contexts

## üß© Key Skills
- Identifying mathematical patterns and sequences
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller parts
- Analyzing relationships between numbers and operations
- Comparing different problem-solving strategies

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Prompts (‚â§10s each)
1. "Look at this pattern: 2, 4, 6, 8. What comes next and why?"
2. "Compare these two ways to solve 15 √ó 4. Which is easier?"
3. "If prices go up by 100 francs each month, what pattern do you see?"
4. "Analyze why some numbers can be divided evenly by 2 and others cannot."
5. "What's the relationship between addition and multiplication?"

## üé§ Expected Student Responses
- Pattern recognition: "10, because it goes up by 2 each time"
- Strategy comparison: "The second way is easier because...", "I prefer the first method because..."
- Trend analysis: "Prices increase by the same amount", "It's a steady increase"
- Mathematical reasoning: "Even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8", "Odd numbers can't be divided evenly"
- Relationship identification: "Multiplication is repeated addition", "4 √ó 3 is the same as 4 + 4 + 4"

## ‚úÖ Assessment Criteria (PASS/FAIL)
**PASS Requirements:**
- Identifies patterns in 3 out of 5 mathematical scenarios
- Provides logical reasoning for mathematical relationships
- Demonstrates ability to break down complex problems

**FAIL Indicators:**
- Cannot identify basic mathematical patterns
- Shows no understanding of mathematical relationships
- Unable to analyze or compare different approaches

## üìä Advancement Rules
- **Promote to Evaluate**: 3 successful sessions out of last 5 attempts
- **Stay at Analyze**: 60-85% success rate with developing analytical skills
- **Demote to Apply**: 3 consecutive failures with pattern recognition

## üåç Cultural Context
- Agricultural patterns: "Coffee harvest increases each year: 100kg, 120kg, 140kg..."
- Population growth: "If Kigali's population grows by 50,000 people each year..."
- Economic trends: "Analyze how mobile money usage has changed over time"
