# Math - Evaluate Stage (Bloom's Taxonomy)

## üéØ Learning Goal
Students will judge the effectiveness of mathematical solutions, evaluate different problem-solving approaches, and make informed decisions about mathematical strategies.

## üìñ Source & Content
- **Primary Source**: Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction
- **Page/Chapter**: Chapters 3-4 (Mathematical Reasoning)
- **Supplementary**: Rwandan decision-making contexts

## üß© Key Skills
- Evaluating the efficiency of different mathematical methods
- Judging the reasonableness of mathematical answers
- Assessing the appropriateness of mathematical models
- Making decisions based on mathematical analysis

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Prompts (‚â§10s each)
1. "Which method is better for calculating 25 √ó 16: long multiplication or breaking it down?"
2. "Is an answer of 50,000 francs reasonable for buying 10 notebooks? Why or why not?"
3. "Evaluate this solution: Does it make sense to divide 100 people into 7 equal groups?"
4. "Which is a better deal: 3 items for 1000 francs or 5 items for 1500 francs?"
5. "Judge whether this budget plan is realistic for a family of 4."

## üé§ Expected Student Responses
- Method evaluation: "Breaking it down is easier because 25 √ó 16 = 25 √ó 10 + 25 √ó 6"
- Reasonableness assessment: "No, that's too expensive. Notebooks cost about 500 francs each"
- Solution critique: "It doesn't work perfectly because 100 √∑ 7 = 14 remainder 2"
- Comparative analysis: "5 for 1500 is better because each item costs 300 francs instead of 333"
- Practical evaluation: "The budget seems reasonable because it includes all basic needs"

## ‚úÖ Assessment Criteria (PASS/FAIL)
**PASS Requirements:**
- Makes appropriate judgments about mathematical solutions in 3 out of 5 scenarios
- Provides logical reasoning for evaluations
- Demonstrates understanding of mathematical reasonableness

**FAIL Indicators:**
- Cannot evaluate the appropriateness of mathematical solutions
- Shows no sense of mathematical reasonableness
- Unable to compare different mathematical approaches

## üìä Advancement Rules
- **Promote to Create**: 3 successful sessions out of last 5 attempts
- **Stay at Evaluate**: 70-90% success rate with continued refinement
- **Demote to Analyze**: 3 consecutive failures with evaluation tasks

## üåç Cultural Context
- Business decisions: "Evaluate whether it's profitable to sell bananas at 50 francs each"
- Resource allocation: "Judge the best way to distribute 1000 francs among school supplies"
- Investment choices: "Which savings plan is better for reaching your goals?"
