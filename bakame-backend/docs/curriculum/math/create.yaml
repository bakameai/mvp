ivr_prompt: |
  Now you're the teacher! Create a mental math problem for me to solve.
  Make up a multiplication problem using numbers between 20 and 99, and tell me the best strategy to solve it.
  Then give me the answer. Be creative!

feedback_templates:
  pass: "Fantastic problem creation! You made a good problem and explained a smart strategy to solve it."
  fail_hint: "Try creating a problem like '34 × 25' and think about how to make it easier with rounding or breaking down."
  fail_repeat: "Good effort! Remember to give me the numbers to multiply, a strategy, and the final answer."
  encouragement: "Creating problems is the highest level of math thinking! You're becoming a math teacher!"

emotional_responses:
  hesitation: "Think of two numbers you'd like to multiply. Maybe something like 45 × 12? What strategy would work?"
  confusion: "Here's an example: '48 × 25. Strategy: 48 × 25 = 50 × 25 - 2 × 25 = 1250 - 50 = 1200.'"
  frustration: "Creating your own problems shows you really understand math! You're at the expert level!"
