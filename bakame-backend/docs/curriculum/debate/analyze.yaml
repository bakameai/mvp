ivr_prompt: |
  Let's analyze this argument: "We shouldn't listen to young people about climate change because they're too young to understand complex issues."
  What do you think about this reasoning? Is it strong or weak? What problems do you see?

expected_structure:
  - "â‰¥3 complete sentences"
  - "identifies logical problems"
  - "analyzes argument strength"
  - "explains reasoning flaws"

llm_scoring_criteria:
  temperature: 0.2
  rules:
    - "identifies ad hominem fallacy (attacking person not argument)"
    - "recognizes age-based dismissal as problematic"
    - "analyzes that argument avoids addressing the actual issue"
    - "demonstrates understanding of logical fallacies"
  
keywords:
  positive: ["weak", "fallacy", "attacks person", "avoids issue", "irrelevant", "doesn't address", "unfair"]
  negative: ["strong", "good argument", "makes sense", "agree"]

feedback_templates:
  pass: "Excellent analysis! You identified that attacking someone's age instead of their argument is a logical fallacy."
  fail_hint: "Think about this: does being young automatically make someone wrong? Is age the real issue here?"
  fail_repeat: "Good thinking! This argument attacks the person (young people) instead of addressing their actual points about climate."
  encouragement: "Spotting logical fallacies is advanced critical thinking! You're analyzing like a debate judge."

emotional_responses:
  hesitation: "Consider: if a young person said '2+2=4', would their age make them wrong? What matters more - age or evidence?"
  confusion: "This is called 'ad hominem' - attacking the person instead of their argument. It's a logical fallacy."
  frustration: "Logical analysis is challenging! You're developing sophisticated reasoning skills."
