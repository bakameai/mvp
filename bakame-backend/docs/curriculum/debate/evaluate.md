# Debate - Evaluate Stage (Bloom's Taxonomy)

## 🎯 Learning Goal
Students will judge the overall quality of debates, evaluate the effectiveness of different argument strategies, and make informed decisions about complex issues.

## 📖 Source & Content
- **Primary Source**: The Code of the Debater
- **Page/Chapter**: Chapters 1-2 (Debate Evaluation)
- **Supplementary**: Rwandan governance and decision-making evaluation

## 🧩 Key Skills
- Judging the overall strength of competing arguments
- Evaluating the effectiveness of debate strategies
- Assessing the credibility of sources and speakers
- Making informed decisions based on debate analysis

## 🗣️ Voice Prompts (≤10s each)
1. "Evaluate these two arguments about internet access in schools. Which is more convincing and why?"
2. "Judge the effectiveness of using personal stories versus statistics in debates."
3. "Assess the credibility of these sources: a government report versus a social media post."
4. "Evaluate whether this debate about environmental protection was conducted fairly."
5. "Which argument strategy works better: emotional appeals or logical reasoning?"

## 🎤 Expected Student Responses
- Comparative evaluation: "The first argument is stronger because it provides specific examples and addresses counterarguments"
- Strategy assessment: "Personal stories connect with emotions, but statistics provide solid proof - both are needed"
- Source credibility: "Government reports are more reliable because they're based on research, social media can be anyone's opinion"
- Process evaluation: "The debate was fair because both sides got equal time and respected each other"
- Strategic judgment: "Logical reasoning is more convincing for important decisions, but emotional appeals help people care about the issue"
