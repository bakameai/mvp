# Debate - Analyze Stage (Bloom's Taxonomy)

## üéØ Learning Goal
Students will break down complex arguments, identify logical fallacies, analyze the strength of evidence, and examine the structure of debates.

## üìñ Source & Content
- **Primary Source**: Policy Debate Textbook
- **Page/Chapter**: Chapters 3-4 (Argument Analysis)
- **Supplementary**: Rwandan political and social discourse analysis

## üß© Key Skills
- Identifying strengths and weaknesses in arguments
- Analyzing the quality and relevance of evidence
- Breaking down complex debates into component parts
- Recognizing bias and logical fallacies

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Prompts (‚â§10s each)
1. "Analyze this argument: 'We should ban cars because my neighbor's car is noisy.' What's wrong with it?"
2. "Break down this debate: What are the main points on each side of school uniform policies?"
3. "Examine this evidence: 'A survey of 10 people shows everyone loves mathematics.' Is it strong?"
4. "Analyze why this reasoning is flawed: 'All politicians are corrupt because one was caught stealing.'"
5. "What are the key components that make this argument about education funding strong or weak?"

## üé§ Expected Student Responses
- Fallacy identification: "That's not fair because one noisy car doesn't represent all cars", "It's too general"
- Structural analysis: "Pro-uniform side says equality and focus, anti-uniform side says freedom and cost"
- Evidence critique: "10 people is too small a sample", "We need more people to make it reliable"
- Logical reasoning: "That's stereotyping - you can't judge all politicians by one person's actions"
- Comprehensive evaluation: "The argument is strong because it uses government statistics, but weak because it ignores other factors"

## ‚úÖ Assessment Criteria (PASS/FAIL)
**PASS Requirements:**
- Correctly analyzes argument structure in 3 out of 5 scenarios
- Identifies logical problems or strengths in reasoning
- Demonstrates ability to evaluate evidence quality

**FAIL Indicators:**
- Cannot identify basic flaws in reasoning
- Shows no understanding of evidence evaluation
- Unable to break down arguments into components

## üìä Advancement Rules
- **Promote to Evaluate**: 3 successful sessions out of last 5 attempts
- **Stay at Analyze**: 60-85% success rate with developing analytical skills
- **Demote to Apply**: 3 consecutive failures with argument analysis

## üåç Cultural Context
- Media literacy: "Analyze news reports about Rwanda's development - what evidence do they use?"
- Political discourse: "Examine how different parties present their arguments about education policy"
- Community decisions: "Break down the arguments for and against building a new market in your sector"
