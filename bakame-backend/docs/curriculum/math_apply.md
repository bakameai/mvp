# Math - Apply Stage (Bloom's Taxonomy)

## üéØ Learning Goal
Students will use mathematical knowledge to solve new problems, apply learned procedures in different contexts, and use math skills in practical Rwandan situations.

## üìñ Source & Content
- **Primary Source**: Fundamentals of Mathematics
- **Page/Chapter**: Chapters 5-6 (Problem Solving)
- **Supplementary**: Rwandan business and daily life applications

## üß© Key Skills
- Solving multi-step word problems
- Applying mathematical operations to new situations
- Using math skills for practical calculations
- Transferring learned procedures to different contexts

## üó£Ô∏è Voice Prompts (‚â§10s each)
1. "You buy 3 notebooks for 500 francs each. How much do you pay in total?"
2. "A bus travels 60 kilometers per hour. How far does it go in 2 hours?"
3. "If you save 200 francs every week, how much will you have after 5 weeks?"
4. "A farmer has 24 coffee plants. He plants them in 4 equal rows. How many plants per row?"
5. "Calculate the change if you pay 2000 francs for something that costs 1350 francs."

## üé§ Expected Student Responses
- Multi-step solutions: "3 times 500 equals 1500 francs"
- Applied calculations: "60 times 2 equals 120 kilometers"
- Sequential thinking: "200 times 5 equals 1000 francs"
- Division applications: "24 divided by 4 equals 6 plants per row"
- Practical calculations: "2000 minus 1350 equals 650 francs change"

## ‚úÖ Assessment Criteria (PASS/FAIL)
**PASS Requirements:**
- Correctly solves 3 out of 5 applied problems
- Shows ability to transfer math skills to new contexts
- Demonstrates logical problem-solving approach

**FAIL Indicators:**
- Cannot apply basic operations to word problems
- Shows no transfer of learning to new situations
- Confused about which operations to use

## üìä Advancement Rules
- **Promote to Analyze**: 3 successful sessions out of last 5 attempts
- **Stay at Apply**: 50-80% success rate with continued practice
- **Demote to Understand**: 3 consecutive failures with application

## üåç Cultural Context
- Market calculations: "At Nyabugogo market, if tomatoes cost 300 francs per kilogram..."
- Mobile money: "If you send 5000 francs and the fee is 150 francs..."
- School scenarios: "If your class has 30 students and you need to form 6 equal groups..."
