# English - Analyze Stage (Bloom's Taxonomy)

## 🎯 Learning Goal
Students will break down English texts and conversations, identify patterns and relationships, and analyze language structures to understand deeper meanings.

## 📖 Source & Content
- **Primary Source**: English Textbooks - Reading Comprehension
- **Page/Chapter**: Chapters 5-7 (Text Analysis)
- **Supplementary**: Rwandan literature adaptations

## 🧩 Key Skills
- Identifying main ideas and supporting details
- Analyzing sentence structure and grammar patterns
- Comparing different ways to express the same idea
- Breaking down complex sentences into parts

## 🗣️ Voice Prompts (≤10s each)
1. "I'll tell you a story. Listen and tell me what the main problem was."
2. "Why do you think the character made that choice?"
3. "What's the difference between 'I am happy' and 'I feel happy'?"
4. "Listen to these two sentences. Which one sounds more polite?"
5. "What clues in the story tell us how the person was feeling?"

## 🎤 Expected Student Responses
- Analytical thinking: "The main problem was...", "The character wanted..."
- Reasoning: "Because he was scared", "She needed to help her family"
