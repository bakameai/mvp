  Hello! Let's practice some basic grammar. I'll ask you a few questions about English sentences. 
  Listen carefully: "I go to school yesterday." Is this sentence correct? Tell me what you think.

  negative: ["correct", "right", "good", "fine"]

feedback_templates:
  pass: "Excellent! You spotted the grammar mistake. 'I went to school yesterday' is correct because we use past tense with 'yesterday'."
  fail_hint: "Think about when this happened. Yesterday is in the past, so what form of 'go' should we use?"
  fail_repeat: "Good try! Remember: yesterday = past time, so we say 'went' not 'go'. Let's try another one."
  encouragement: "Grammar can be tricky, even for adults! You're learning step by step."

emotional_responses:
  hesitation: "Take your time. There's no rush. Think about the time word 'yesterday'."
  confusion: "Let me help you. When we talk about yesterday, we use past tense verbs like 'went'."
  frustration: "You're doing great! Learning grammar takes practice. Let's break it down together."
