  Now let's analyze grammar patterns. Listen to these two sentences: "I am going to school" and "I will go to school."
  What's the difference between these two ways of talking about the future? Explain when you would use each one.

expected_structure:
  - "â‰¥2 complete sentences"
  - "identifies future tense difference"
  - "explains usage contexts"
  - "shows analytical thinking"

  rules:
    - "distinguishes between 'going to' and 'will' future forms"

  negative: ["same", "no difference", "don't know"]

feedback_templates:
  pass: "Great analysis! You understand that 'going to' shows plans and 'will' shows quick decisions."
  fail_hint: "Think about this: 'going to' is for plans you made before. 'Will' is for decisions you make right now."
  fail_repeat: "Good effort! 'Going to' = planned future. 'Will' = spontaneous future. Try explaining again."
  encouragement: "Analyzing grammar takes practice. You're thinking like a language expert!"

emotional_responses:
  hesitation: "Think about when you make plans versus when you decide something suddenly."
  confusion: "Let me give an example: 'I'm going to study tonight' (planned) vs 'I'll help you' (spontaneous)."
  frustration: "This is advanced grammar! You're tackling difficult concepts. Keep going!"
