# Language/Knowledge Split Documentation

## Overview

The BAKAME IVR system implements a sophisticated language scaffolding approach that separates language mechanics from knowledge assessment. This ensures that students are evaluated on their understanding and communication success rather than perfect grammar, while still providing gentle guidance for language improvement.

## Core Principles

### 1. Meaning-First Evaluation
- **Primary Focus**: Understanding and communication success
- **Secondary Focus**: Grammar and pronunciation accuracy
- **Philosophy**: A student who communicates their idea effectively has succeeded, regardless of minor grammatical errors

### 2. Gentle Correction Without Interruption
- **Non-Intrusive**: Corrections don't interrupt the flow of learning
- **Encouraging**: Feedback emphasizes effort and improvement
- **Contextual**: Corrections are relevant to the student's current level

### 3. Cultural and Linguistic Sensitivity
- **Accent Tolerance**: Rwandan English patterns are recognized and accepted
- **Code-Switching**: Natural mixing of Kinyarwanda and English is supported
- **Regional Patterns**: Common East African English structures are understood

## Implementation Architecture

### Language Scaffolding Service

The `LanguageScaffoldingService` handles the separation of language and knowledge:

```python
async def process_with_scaffolding(self, user_input: str, focus_on_meaning: bool = True) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    """
    Process user input with language scaffolding
    Returns: (corrected_text, feedback_message, needs_gentle_correction)
    """
```

### Key Components

1. **Meaning Extraction**: Preserves student intent while improving clarity
2. **Gentle Feedback Generation**: Creates encouraging correction messages
3. **Communication Success Assessment**: Evaluates effectiveness regardless of grammar

## Common Pattern Recognition

### Missing Articles and Prepositions
- **Pattern**: "I go school" → "I go to school"
- **Approach**: Fill in missing words without changing meaning
- **Feedback**: "Good try! I added 'to' to make it clearer."

### Verb Tense Corrections
- **Pattern**: "I go school yesterday" → "I went to school yesterday"
- **Approach**: Correct tense while preserving the student's vocabulary choices
- **Feedback**: "Nice! I helped with the verb tense."

### Regional English Patterns
- **Pattern**: "I have went" → "I have gone"
- **Approach**: Recognize common East African English patterns
- **Feedback**: "Great idea! I fixed the past participle."

## Assessment Integration

### Multi-Factor Scoring

The assessment system uses three weighted factors:

1. **Keyword Matching (40%)**: Content relevance and vocabulary usage
2. **Sentence Structure (30%)**: Basic grammatical completeness
3. **LLM Evaluation (30%)**: Meaning, effort, and appropriateness

### Communication Success Metrics

```python
def assess_communication_success(self, user_input: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "communication_successful": bool,  # Primary success indicator
        "meaning_clarity": float,          # 0.0-1.0 clarity score
        "effort_level": float,             # 0.0-1.0 effort assessment
        "needs_support": bool              # Requires additional help
    }
```

## Scaffolding Strategies

### Focus Areas Based on Error Patterns

1. **Focus on Structure**: When grammar errors are frequent
2. **Focus on Words**: When vocabulary is the primary challenge
3. **Focus on Clarity**: When pronunciation affects understanding
4. **Focus on Meaning**: Default approach for most interactions

### Intervention Decisions

The system decides when to provide immediate correction based on:
- **Error Severity**: Minor vs. major communication breakdowns
- **Student Confidence**: Lower confidence triggers more support
- **Learning Context**: Assessment vs. free conversation

## Cultural Context Integration

### Rwandan English Patterns

Common patterns recognized and gently corrected:

- **Missing Copula**: "My mother teacher" → "My mother is a teacher"
- **Preposition Variations**: "I stay at home" (accepted as valid)
- **Plural Markers**: "Two book" → "Two books"

### Ubuntu Philosophy in Corrections

- **Community Support**: "We're learning together"
- **Effort Recognition**: "Your idea is excellent"
- **Growth Mindset**: "Every mistake helps us improve"

## Example Interactions

### Successful Scaffolding

**Student Input**: "I go market buy banana for mama"
**Corrected**: "I went to the market to buy bananas for mama"
**Feedback**: "Great story! I added some connecting words to make it flow better."
**Assessment**: PASS (meaning clear, effort evident, culturally relevant)

### Meaning Preservation

**Student Input**: "My school it have many student"
**Corrected**: "My school has many students"
**Feedback**: "Good description! I helped with the verb and plural."
**Assessment**: PASS (clear communication about school environment)

### Encouraging Retry

**Student Input**: "I... um... go..."
**Corrected**: "I go..."
**Feedback**: "Take your time! You're doing great. What did you do?"
**Assessment**: RETRY (needs encouragement and support)

## Configuration and Tuning

### Scaffolding Sensitivity

```python
# Adjust scaffolding based on student needs
scaffolding_config = {
    "correction_threshold": 0.7,      # When to suggest corrections
    "interruption_threshold": 0.3,    # When to interrupt for major errors
    "encouragement_frequency": 0.8,   # How often to provide positive feedback
    "cultural_context_weight": 0.9    # Emphasis on cultural relevance
}
```

### Error Tolerance Levels

- **Beginner**: High tolerance, focus on communication
- **Intermediate**: Moderate corrections, maintain flow
- **Advanced**: More precise feedback, higher standards

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Success Metrics

- **Communication Success Rate**: Percentage of meaningful exchanges
- **Scaffolding Effectiveness**: Improvement in subsequent attempts
- **Student Confidence**: Engagement and willingness to continue
- **Cultural Relevance**: Use of appropriate context and examples

### Quality Assurance

Regular review of:
- Correction accuracy and appropriateness
- Student response to feedback
- Cultural sensitivity of examples
- Effectiveness of scaffolding strategies

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Test with Real Patterns**: Use actual Rwandan English samples
2. **Validate Corrections**: Ensure meaning is preserved
3. **Monitor Feedback**: Track student response to corrections
4. **Cultural Review**: Regular validation of cultural appropriateness

### For Educators
